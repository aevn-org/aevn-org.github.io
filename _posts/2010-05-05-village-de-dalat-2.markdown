  indeed, the Village is 35 years. A bright blue skye, that was a magnificent day.
  Our Village was filled with colored flags, posters and banners. A cloud of playing
  and speaking children was invading the Village.<br />Nevertheless and above all,
  that was a few days earlier that the happiest atmosphere was prevailing in the houses
  with the arrival of the Village's alumni, their spouses and children. Three generations
  were present: Grand-mothers, parents and grand-children. Seemingless never ending
  stories were told during lunch and dinner.<br />Mr. Helmut Kutin, SOS Children's
  Villages International Federation President, was specially visiting the Village
  for this birthday that was attended by many Dalat companies' and Lam Dong province's
  delegates and representatives, as well. During the one hour and thirty minutes ceremony,
  a report on the Dalat Children's Village creation and development, and its associated
  projects, was read. At the same time, danses and music were performed by the children.<br
  />With this ceremony, our children were lucky to express their gratitude toward
  Aid to the Children of Vietnam (ACVN), SOS Vietnam and SOS International. That was
  also for them an opportunity to carry on with the Village tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr
