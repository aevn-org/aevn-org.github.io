  acting for the development of their own country!

  class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">ACVN has been working since 1970 on the basis of
  four principles established in 1949 by Hermann Gmeiner in Imst, Austria: the mother,
  the brothers and sisters, the house and the Village.

  class=\"p4\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The SOS mother creates
  a close relationship with all the children she is entrusted with and brings them
  the security, love and stability that they need. Professionally trained to take
  care of children, she lives with them, directs their development and manages her
  household in an autonomous way. She knows and respects each child’s family history,
  original culture and religion.
