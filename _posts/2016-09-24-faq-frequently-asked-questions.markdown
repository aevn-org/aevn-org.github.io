  une asscociation\"></a><strong>Question: Why an association to help the children
  of Vietnam?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Even though the wars which
  devastated Vietnam from 1945 to 1975 are now remote, and in spite of economic progress,
  many children in Vietnam still live in precarious conditions, having lost their
  father and/or mother, or with parents who cannot sustain them, nor send them to
  school. The SOS Children's Villages created by ACVN give them a family environment
  and an education, so that they get started in life with a fair chance.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a
  name=\"Quelle est la particularite\"></a><br />Question: What is special about ACVN?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
  ACVN gives orphans a family framework within the Village and the opportunity to
  make their own way in the world when they leave the Village, thanks to the emphasis
  placed on eduction and school work.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong><a name=\"Puis-je faire
  confiance a AEVN\"></a>Question: Can I trust ACVN?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Answer:
  </strong>Aid to the Children of Vietnam is a partner of the International SOS Children's
  Villages Federation, which is one of the largest associations dedicated to the long-term
  care of orphans and abandoned children. Women and men choosing to sponsor children
  are in regular contact with them. ACVN has been active for more than forty years;
  it has built three Villages in Vietnam; it is running them and taking care of all
  the children until they become independent adults.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"Combien
  d’enfants\"></a>Question: How many children are helped by ACVN?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
  The three Villages built by ACVN house about 300 children, aged one to twenty-one
  years. ACVN continues to take care of the children when they reach adulthood, either
  by helping them find work, or in some cases by offering them scholarships to go
  to college.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br /><a name=\"Comment aider\"></a>Question: How
  can I help?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If you want to support ACVN,
  it is of course possible to make either a one-time donation, or a repeating one.
  For a deeper involvement, you may choose to sponsor a child, with whom you will
  be in contact by mail. Finally, you may also want to buy some of our postcards to
  send to family or friends.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong><a name=\"Les dons sont-ils\"></a>Question:
  Are donations eligible for tax deductions (French residents)?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
